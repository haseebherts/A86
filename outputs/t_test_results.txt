Test Results:

	Welch Two Sample t-test

data:  df2$perc_18_29 by df2$period
t = -2.1562, df = 21.376, p-value = 0.0426
alternative hypothesis: true difference in means between group Early (1-12) and group Later (13-24) is not equal to 0
95 percent confidence interval:
 -2.36432029 -0.04401304
sample estimates:
 mean in group Early (1-12) mean in group Later (13-24) 
                   23.26250                    24.46667 



Interpretation:
The p-value ( 0.0426 ) is less than 0.05.
We REJECT the null hypothesis.
There is a statistically significant difference in means.
